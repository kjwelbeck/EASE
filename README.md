== EASE | Expediting Access to Standard Education

This is a static web-application detailing/chronicling the functions and functioning of the EASE organination running operations out of MIT.
This website presents the exisitng contents of the current website edition with a new more professional and impressive presentation, tying in with the renovative spirit of our current personnel. 

The existing website includes the following pages:
Home, with a welcome message, a flash page-like picture
About Us, with a expose of the mission of the organisation
Board Members profile page
Partners
Get Involved with Join Us, Volunteer and Donate subsections
Events, linking to a google calendar
News
Gallery
FAQs
Contact Us, linking to an email to ease-exec@mit.edu

A major feature change is opening with a newsfeed page, which would be the most dynamic content, perhaps. The welcome message, if any, would still be on the home page
