<p> Welcome!</p>
<p>Great news, you can now donate to EASE through the MIT Giving Website! <p>

<p> Every year, millions of children in Africa are denied access to basic education due to poverty! </p>

<p>EASE is an MIT-student initiative founded with the primary aim of making basic education more accessible to underprivileged children in Africa. We realize that this is a enormous task, but as the wise will say, a journey of a hundred years begins with one step. </p>

<p>Supporting child education since April, 2002 </p>
